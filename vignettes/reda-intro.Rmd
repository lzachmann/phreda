The package **reda** mainly provides function to fit gamma frailty model with
either a piecewise constant or a spline as the baseline rate function
for recurrent event data. What's more, some handy functions are designed,
such as computing and plotting sample nonparametric mean cumulative function,
or so-called Nelson-Aalen estimator. Most functions in this package
are S4 methods that produce S4 class objects.

In this vignette, we mainly introduce the basic usage of the functions
provided in the package by examples. The details of function syntax
and slots of the objects produced are available in the package manual,
which will thus not be covered in this vignette.

An outline of the remainder of the vignette is as follows:
We first introduce the [simulated sample recurrent event data](#simuDat)
and the [data checking](#dataCheck) rules.
After then, the demonstration of the main function `rateReg` for
[model fitting](#rateReg) is provided, which includes fitting model with
(one piece) [constant](#constFit), [piecewise constant](#piecesFit),
and [spline](#splineFit) baseline rate function.
What follows next are the examples of functions that
[summarize](#summaryFit) the model fitted and
functions for [model selection](#modelSelect) based on AIC or BIC.
Last but not the least, the demonstration of estimation and
the mean cumulative function (MCF) is given, which includes
[sample MCF](#sampleMcf) and [estimated MCF](#rateRegMcf)
from the fitted model.


## Simulated Sample Recurrent Event Data {#simuDat}

```{r setup}
library(reda) # attach package
data(simuDat) # attach sample dataset
```

First of all, the sample recurrent event data
we are going to use in the following examples is called `simuDat`,
which contains totally `r nrow(simuDat)` observations of `r ncol(simuDat)`
variables.

```{r data}
head(simuDat)
str(simuDat)
```

where

* ID: Subjects identification.
* time: Event or censoring time.
* event: Event indicator, 1 = event; 0 = censored.
* group: Treatment group indicator.
* x1: Continuous variable.

The dataset is originally simulated by thinning method [@lewis1979]
and further processed for a better demonstration purpose.


## Data Checking {#dataCheck}

In the main function `rateReg` for model fitting, formula response is specified
by function `Survr`, which has a considerate data checking procedure embedded
for recurrent event data modeled by method based on counts and rate
function. Therefore, before model fitting, the observations of the covariates
specified in the formula will be checked.  The checking rules include

* Identification of each subject cannot be missing.
* Event indicator must be coded as 0 (censored) or 1 (event).
* Event time and censoring time cannot be missing.
* Each subject must have one and only one censoring time.
* Event time cannot not be later than censoring time.

The subject's ID will be pinpointed if its observation violates any checking
rule shown above.


## Model Fitting {#rateReg}

### Model with Constant Rate Function {#constFit}

The default model when argument `df`, `knots`, and `degree` are not
specified is gamma frailty model with (one piece) constant rate function,
which is equivalent to negative binomial regression with the same
shape and rate parameter in the gamma prior.

```{r const}
(constFit <- rateReg(Survr(ID, time, event) ~ group + x1, data = simuDat))
```

The function `rateReg` returns `rateReg-class` object, which can be
printed out by calling the object.
(Internally, `show` method for `rateReg` object is called.)


### Model with Piecewise Constant Rate Function {#piecesFit}

When argument `df` or `knots` (at least one internal knot) is specified,
the model becomes gamma frailty model with piecewise constant rate function
or so-called HEART model [@fu2014]
if argument degree is specified to be zero as default.

We may specify `df` and leave `knots` and `degree` as default.
Then piecewise constant rate function will be applied and the number of pieces
will equal `df`. The internal knots will be automatically specified at
suitable quantiles of the covariate representing event and censoring time.

For example, two pieces' constant rate function can be simply specified by
setting `df = 2`. The internal knot will be the median time of all the event and
censoring time. Also, we can fit the models on the first 50 subjects by
specifying argument `subset`.

```{r twoPieces}
# two pieces' constant rate function
(twoPiecesFit <- rateReg(Survr(ID, time, event) ~ group + x1, df = 2,
                         data = simuDat, subset = ID %in% 1:50))
```

In the example shown above, the internal knots is set automatically to be
`r twoPiecesFit@spline$knots` and the baseline rate function is two
pieces' constant.

If internal `knots` are specified explicitly, the `df` will be neglected
even if it is specified. An example of model with six pieces' constant rate
function is given as follows:

```{r sixPieces}
## df = 2 will be neglected since knots are explicitly specified
(piecesFit <- rateReg(Survr(ID, time, event) ~ group + x1, df = 2,
                      data = simuDat, subset = ID %in% 1:50,
                      knots = seq(from = 28, to = 140, by = 28)))
```


### Model with Spline Rate Function {#splineFit}

When argument `degree` is specified to be a positive integer, the baseline rate
function is fitted by splines.  The type or flavor of the splines can be
specified by argument `spline`.  The available option for `spline` are
`bSplines` for B-splines and `mSplines` for M-splines. (See **R** package
**spline2** for details about the spline functions used internally.)
A partial matching on names is allowed.

For example, one may want to fit the baseline rate function by
a cubic spline with two internal knots. Then we may explicitly
specify `degree = 3` and `knots` to be a length-two numeric vector.
Or we may simply specify `degree = 3` and `df = 6`
Then the internal knots will be automatically specified at
suitable quantiles of the covariate representing event and censoring time.
Generally speaking, the degree of freedom of spline
(or the number of spline bases) equals the summation of
the number of internal knots and the degree of each spline base,
plus one if intercept is included in spline bases.

```{r spline}
## internal knots are set as 33% and 67% quantiles of time variable
(splineFit <- rateReg(Survr(ID, time, event) ~ group + x1,
                      data = simuDat, subset = ID %in% 1:50,
                      df = 6, degree = 3, spline = "mSplines"))
## or internal knots are expicitly specified
(splineFit <- rateReg(Survr(ID, time, event) ~ group + x1,
                      data = simuDat, subset = ID %in% 1:50,
                      spline = "bSplines", degree = 3L, knots = c(56, 112)))
```


## Summary of Model Fits {#summaryFit}

A brief summary of the fitted model is  given by `show` method
as shown in the previous examples. Further, `summary` method for
`rateReg-class` object provides a more specific summary
of the model fitted. For instance, the summary of the models fitted
in section of model fitting can be called as follows:

```{r summary}
summary(constFit)
summary(piecesFit, showCall = FALSE)
summary(splineFit, showCall = FALSE, showKnots = FALSE)
```

The summary includes the function call, estimated covariate coefficients,
estimated parameter of frailty variable, internal knots (if exist),
boundary knots, degree of spline bases if splines are applied,
coefficients of rate function bases (pieces), and log-likelihood
of the model fitted. Outputs of function call or knots,
may be suppressed by specifying argument `showCall` or `showKnots`
to be `FALSE`, respectively, in `summary` method, which would be
especially useful for a relatively concise summary
in a reproducible report using **Rmarkdown**, etc.

What's more, the corresponding `coef` and `confint` method
for point estimates and confidence interval for covariate coefficients
are provided as well. The estimated coefficients of baseline rate function
can be given by function `baseRate`.
Let's take the fitted model with spline rate function as an example.

```{r est}
## point estimates of covariate coefficients
coef(splineFit)
## confidence interval for covariate coefficients
confint(splineFit, level = 0.95)
## estimated coefficients of baseline rate function
baseRate(splineFit)
```


## Model Selection {#modelSelect}

Two handy functions are provided for model selection.
We may compare and select the models with different baseline rate function
based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) by function `AIC` or
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) by function `BIC`.

A friendly warning will be thrown out if the numbers of observation were
different in the model comparison by AIC.

```{r }
AIC(constFit, piecesFit, splineFit)
BIC(constFit, piecesFit, splineFit)
```


## Mean Cumulative Function (MCF)

The generic function to compute the sample MCF and
the estimated MCF from the fitted model is called `mcf`.
Another related generic function called `plotMcf` plots the
estimated MCF by using **ggplot2** plotting system.


### Sample MCF (Nelson-Aalen Estimator) {#sampleMcf}

The nonparametric sample MCF is also called
Nelson-Aalen Estimator [@nelson2003]. The point estimate of MCF
at each time point does not assume any particular underlying model.
The variance estimates
at each time point is given by Poisson process method (by default)
or Lawless and Nadeau method [@lawless1995some].
The approximate confidence intervals are provided as well,
which are constructed based on the asymptotic normality
of logarithm of MCF (by default) or MCF itself directly.
@reliawiki also provided a simple example.

If a formula with `Survr` as response is specified in function `mcf`, the method
for sample MCF will be called.  The covariate specified at the right hand side
of the formula should be either `1` or any "linear" combination of factor
variables in the data.  The former computes the overall sample MCF.  The latter
computes the sample MCF for each level of the combination of the factor
variable(s) specified, respectively.

The valve-seat dataset in @nelson1995confidence and the sample simulated data
are used for demonstration as folllows:

```{r sampleMcf}
## overall sample MCF for valve-seat data in Nelson (1995)
valveMcf <- mcf(Survr(ID, Days, No.) ~ 1, data = valveSeats)

## sample MCF for different groups
simuMcf <- mcf(Survr(ID, time, event) ~ group + gender,
               data = simuDat, subset = ID %in% 1 : 50, logConfInt = FALSE)
```

After estimation, we may plot the sample MCF by function `plotMcf`, which
actually returns a `ggplot` object so that the plot produced can be easily
further customized by functions in package **ggplot2**.  The `legendname` and
`legendLevels` can be used to customize the legend in the plot. Examples are
given as follows:

```{r plot:sampleMcf, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
## Example 1. valve-seat data
plotMcf(valveMcf, conf.int = TRUE, mark.time = TRUE) + ggplot2::xlab("Days")

## Example 2. sample simulated data
## plot after creating customized levels in legend
levs <- with(simuDat, expand.grid(levels(group), levels(gender)))
levs <- do.call(paste, c(as.list(levs), sep = " & "))
plotMcf(simuMcf, conf.int = TRUE, lty = 1 : 4,
        legendName = "Treatment & Gender", legendLevels = levs) +
    ggplot2::xlab("Days") + ggplot2::theme_bw()
```

Note that all the censoring time can be marked on the
step curve by specifying `mark.time = TRUE`.
The type and color of the line can be specified through
`lty` and `col`, respectively.


### Estimated MCF from the fitted Model {#rateRegMcf}

If `rateReg-class` object is supplied to function `mcf`,
the method for `rateReg-class` is called, which returns
the estimated baseline MCF from the fitted model
if `newdata` is not specified in the function.

The example estimating and plotting
the baseline MCF from the fitted model
with piecewise constant rate function is shown as follows:

```{r piecesMcf, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
piecesMcf <- mcf(piecesFit)
plotMcf(piecesMcf, conf.int = TRUE, col = "blueviolet") +
    ggplot2::xlab("Days") + ggplot2::theme_bw()
```

The argument `newdata` allows one to estimate the MCF for a given dataset
instead of the baseline MCF. If `newdata` is specified, the data frame should
have the same column names as the covariate names appearing in the formula
of original fitting. The MCF will be estimated for each unique row
in the data frame and its confidence intervals are constructed
based on Delta-method.

In addition, we may specify the name for grouping each unique row and
the levels of each group through `groupName` and `groupLevels`, respectively.
For example, we may specify `groupName = "Gender"` and
`groupLevels = c("Male", "Female")` for estimation
of different gender groups.

As the last example in this vignette,
we estimate the MCF from fitted model with
spline rate function for the different treatment groups and plot the
estimated MCFs and their confidence intervals correspondingly.

```{r splineMcf, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
newDat <- data.frame(x1 = rep(0, 2), group = c("Treat", "Contr"))
estmcf <- mcf(splineFit, newdata = newDat, groupName = "Group",
              groupLevels = c("Treatment", "Control"))
plotMcf(estmcf, conf.int = TRUE, col = c("royalblue", "red"), lty = c(1, 5)) +
    ggplot2::ggtitle("Control vs. Treatment") + ggplot2::xlab("Days")
```
