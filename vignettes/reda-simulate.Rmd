In this vignette, we briefly introduce how to simulate survival and recurrent
event data from stochastic process point of view with **reda** package.  The
core function named `simEvent` provides an intuitive and flexible interface for
simulating survival and recurrent event times from one stochastic process.
Another function named `simEventData` is simply a wrapper that calls `simEvent`
internally and collects event times and covariates of a given number of
processes into a data frame format.  Examples of generating random samples from
common survival and recurrent models are provided. The details of function
syntax and the objects produced are available in the package manual and thus not
covered in this vignette.


## Introduction {#intro}

### Intensity function {#intensity}

We first introduce the general form of hazard rate function considered and
implemented in the function `simEvent`.


Consider $n$ stochastic processes with the baseline hazard rate function
$\rho(t)$ of time $t$.  For the stochastic process $i$, $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$,
let $\mathbf{z}_i=(z_{i1},\ldots,z_{ip})^{\top}$ denote the covariate vector of
length $p$, and $\boldsymbol{\beta}=(\beta_1,\ldots,\beta_p)^{\top}$ denote the
covariate coefficients.  We may incorporate the covariates and their
coefficients into the stochastic process by specifying the intensity as a
function of time $t$ and the covariates $\mathbf{z}_i$ as follows: $$\lambda(t
\mid \mathbf{z}_i) = \rho(t)\,r(\mathbf{z}_i, \boldsymbol{\beta}),$$ where
$r(\mathbf{z}_i, \boldsymbol{\beta})$ is the relative risk function. For the
regular Cox model [@cox1972jrssb] or the Andersen-Gill model [@andersen1982aos],
$r(\mathbf{z}_i, \boldsymbol{\beta})=
\exp\{\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\top}\mathbf{z}_i\}$. Other common choices include the
linear relative risk model: $r(\mathbf{z}_i, \boldsymbol{\beta}) = 1 +
\boldsymbol{\beta}^{\top}\mathbf{z}_i$, and the excess relative risk model:
$r(\mathbf{z}_i, \boldsymbol{\beta}) = \prod_{j=1}^p(1 + \beta_j z_{ij})$.


We may extend the model by considering a random frailty effect $w_i$ (with
expectation one) to account for heterogeneity between different processes or
processes from different clusters. The intensity function becomes $$\lambda(t
\mid \mathbf{z}_i, w_i) = \rho(t)\,r(\mathbf{z}_i, \boldsymbol{\beta})\,w_i.$$
The common choices for distribution of the random frailty effect include Gamma
distribution of mean one, and lognormal distribution of mean zero in logarithm
scale.


Furthermore, both covariates and coefficients may be time-varying. So the
general form of the intensity function is given as follows: $$\lambda\bigl(t
\mid \mathbf{z}_i(t), w_i\bigr) = \rho(t)\,r\bigl(\mathbf{z}_i(t),
\boldsymbol{\beta}(t)\bigr)\,w_i.$$


### Sampling methods

The thinning method [@lewis1979nrlq]

## Getting started {#getting-started}

```{r setup}
library(reda)                    # attach reda package to the search path
packageVersion("reda")           # check the package version
options(digits = 3)              # set the number of significant digits to print
set.seed(123)                    # set random number seed
```

## Poisson process {#poisson-process}

### Homogeneous Poisson process {#hpp}

A homogeneous Poisson process (HPP) has a constant hazard rate over time and the
interarrival times between two successive arrivals/events following exponential
distribution.  Two simple examples of simulating a homogeneous Poisson process
using `simEvent` are given as follows:

```{r hpp}
## HPP from time 1 to 5 of intensity 1 without covariates
simEvent(rho = 1, origin = 1, endTime = 5)
## HPP from 0 to 10 of baseline rate 0.5 with two covariates
simEvent(z = c(0.2, 0.5), zCoef = c(1, - 0.5), rho = 0.5, endTime = 10)
```

The function `simEventData` enable us to simulate multiple processes and collect
the simulated event times into a survival or recurrent event data format.

```{r hpp-data-1}
## recurrent events from two processes with same covariates
simEventData(2, z = c(0.2, 0.5), zCoef = c(1, - 0.5), rho = 0.01, endTime = 5)
```

In the example given above, the number of process is explicitly specified to be
two.  However, if it is not specified, it will be the number of rows of the
covariate matrix. See the example given below.

```{r hpp-data-2}
## recurrent events from two processes
## with different time-invariant covariate and time origin
simEventData(z = cbind(rnorm(2), 0.5), zCoef = c(0.2, - 0.5),
             rho = 0.01, origin = c(1, 3), endTime = c(8, 9))
```

We can also simulate survival data by taking the first event of each process.
Setting `recurrent = FALSE` in function `simEvent` (or function `simEventData`)
gives us the survival time(s) or the right censoring time(s).  In the example
given below, we specified `endTime = "rnorm"` and `arguments = list(endTime =
list(mean = 4))` for generating a random censoring times from normal
distribution with mean 4 and unit standard deviation.

```{r hpp-data-3}
## survival data by set 'recurrent = FALSE'
simEventData(z = cbind(rnorm(10), 1), zCoef = c(0.2, - 1), rho = 0.1,
             origin = c(0, 1), endTime = "rnorm", recurrent = FALSE,
             arguments = list(endTime = list(mean = 4)))
```


### Nonhomogeneous Poisson process {#nhpp}

```{r nhpp}
rhoFun <- function(x, b = 1) (sin(x) + 1) * b
simEvent(rho = rhoFun, endTime = 5)
simEvent(z = rnorm(3), zCoef = rep(0.1, 3), rho = "rhoFun", endTime = 5)
```

```{r nhpp-data}
simEventData(z = cbind(rnorm(2), 0.1), zCoef = rep(0.1, 2),
             rho = "rhoFun", origin = "rnorm", endTime = "rnorm",
             arguments = list(rho = list(b = 0.5),
                              origin = list(mean = 1, sd = 0.1),
                              endTime = list(mean = 5, sd = 0.5)))
```
