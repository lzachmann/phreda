\title{Formula Response for Recurrent Event Data}
\usage{
Survr(ID, time, event, origin = 0, check = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{ID}{Subject identificator.}

\item{time}{Time of reccurence event or censoring. In addition to numeric
values, \code{Date} and \code{difftime} are also supported.}

\item{event}{The event indicator, \code{0 = censored}, \code{1 = event}.}

\item{origin}{The time origin of each subject or process. Different subjects
may have different origins. However, one subject must have the same
origin.}

\item{check}{Logical value suggesting whether to perform data checking
procedure. The default value is \code{TRUE}. \code{FALSE} should be set
with caution and only for processed data already in recerruent event
data framework.}

\item{...}{Other arguments for future usage.}
}
\description{
\code{Survr} is an S3 class that represents
formula response for recurrent event data
modeled by methods based on counts and rate function.
The last letter 'r' in 'Survr' represents 'rate'.
}
\details{
This is a similar function to \code{Survr} in package
\pkg{survrec} but with a more considerate checking procedure embedded for
recurrent event data modeled by methods based on counts and rate function.
The checking rules apply to each subject and include that
\itemize{
    \item Subject identification, event times, censoring time, and event
        indicator cannot be missing or contain missing values.
    \item Event indicator must be coded as 0 (censored) or 1 (event).
    \item There has to be only one censoring time not earlier than
        any event time.
    \item The time origin has to be the same and not later than any event
        time.
}

\code{\link{rateReg}} for model fitting.
