\title{Comparing Two Sample MCF curves}
\usage{
mcfDiff(mcf1, mcf2 = NULL, level = 0.95,
        testVariance = c("robust", "Poisson", "none"), ...)

mcfDiff.test(mcf1, mcf2 = NULL, testVariance = c("robust", "Poisson",
  "none"))
}
\arguments{
\item{mcf1}{A \code{sampleMcf} object representing the MCF for one or two
groups.}

\item{mcf2}{An optional second \code{sampleMcf} object. By default, it is
\code{NULL}.}

\item{level}{A numeric value indicating the confidence level required. The
default value is 0.95.}

\item{testVariance}{A character string specifying the method for computing
the variance estimate for the pseudo-score test statistic proposed by
Cook, Lawless, and Nadeau (1996). The applicable options include
\code{"robust"} (default) for an estimate robust to departures from
Poisson assumptions, \code{"Poisson"} for an estimate for Poisson
process, and \code{"none"} for not performing any test (if only the
difference estimates are of interest).}

\item{...}{Other arguments for future usage.}
}
\value{
A \code{mcfDiff} object that contains the following slots:

\itemize{

\item \code{call}: Function call.

\item \code{MCF}: Estimated Mean cumulative function Difference at each time
point.

\item \code{origin}: Time origins of the two groups.

\item \code{variance}: The method used for variance estimates.

\item \code{logConfInt}: A logical value indicating whether normality is
assumed for \code{log(MCF)} instead of MCF itself.  For \code{mcfDiff}
object, it is always \code{FALSE}.

\item \code{level}: Confidence level specified.

\item \code{test}: A \code{mcfDiff.test} object for the hypothesis test
results.

\description{
This function estimates the sample MCF difference between two groups. Both
the point estimates and the confidence intervals are computed (Lawless and
Nadeau, 1995). The two-sample pseudo-score test proposed by Cook, Lawless,
and Nadeau (1996) is also performed by default.
}
\details{
The null hypothesis of the two-sample pseudo-score test is that there is no
difference between the two sample MCF curves, while the alternative
hypothesis suggests a difference.

The test is based on a family of test statistics proposed by Lawless and
Nadeau (1995). The argument \code{testVariance} specifies the method for
computing the variance estimates of the test statistics under different
model assumption. The variance estimates for a Poisson process, and the
estimate more robust to departures from Poisson assumptions are implemented.

Both constant weight and the linear weight function (with scaling) suggested
in Cook, Lawless, and Nadeau (1996) are implemented. The constant weight is
powerful in cases where the two MCFs are approximately proportional to each
other. The linear weight function is \code{a(u) = t - u}, where \code{u}
represents the time variable and \code{t} is the first time point when the
risk set of either group becomes empty. The linear weight function puts more
emphasis on the difference at earily times than later times and is more
powerful for cases where the MCFs are no longer proportional to each other,
but not crossing. Also see Cook and Lawless (2007, Section 3.7.5) for more
details.
